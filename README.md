# PHP - Pure RestApi with MySQL

**If you find this complicated, that's a good sign of good question time**

PHP is complex and can be made more complex. 

Same as the other backends I designed. I try to use similar patterns although making each complicated over time.

## To Begin:

1. Clone this repo. Or fork this repo if you made changes and feel to share like refactoring the code in some places. Which would be good for feedback and learning.

1. From Step 1 .Copy the folder to your PHP setup. 
 
**On Windows** if using **xampp**. 

Copy to **C:\xammp\htdocs** and paste there. <em>[according to your drive letter]</em>

Postman collection is available within the folder for easier access.

```
PHP.Customer_collection.json
```

Just Import the collection in **postman**

**Database will auto-create** and good to test!

**Next Update** : maybe adding auth like jwt or oath to the project.
